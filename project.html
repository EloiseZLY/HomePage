        <h2>Why I tranfered to computer science:</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Lingyi Zheng and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree
          in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I received my
          bachelor’s degree in business analytics and information in university
          of Iowa. Later I worked as data analyst for 3 years. During my work, I
          used python to manipulate the several excel sheets and save a lot of
          time of our team, and I realized how powerful the technology is to the
          efficiency of our work. My goal is to find an opportunity in this
          field that will allow me to make a difference in the field of
          technology.

        <h3>Professional Introduction (Elevator Pitch) here.</h3>
        <p>
          I am Lingyi. Right now, I am pursuing my computer science master's
          degree at Northeastern University. I’m in the San Francisco campus. I
          have a good command of Data Structure and Algorithms. And I also have
          much experience in Web development and already completed several
          full-stack projects. I’m familiar with different programming languages
          like Python, Java and Javascript. also some frameworks like React and
          flask. For databases, I have experience in MongoDB and MySql. Before
          my master program, I was a data analyst in the healthcare and banking
          industry for 3 years.  I mainly use python and excel to do the
          analysis to analyze franciscee’s sales performance.

        <h2>Accomplishment Stories</h2>
        <h3>Story 1:</h3>
        <p>
          My teammate and I tried to build a full stack project. We have
          different opinions on how to split the job. He thinks we can split by
          frontend and backend, because he want to be a backend engineer and he
          wants me to finish the frontend part. But I think we should split the
          work by functionalities. Eg, one person finishes the log in/ sign up
          part for both front and backend. And the other person finish post
          image part for both front and backend. 1st reason is that we are new
          to full-stack knowledge, i think both of us need to understand and
          practice how to connect frontend and backend and how to store data in
          mongoDB, the whole process. 2nd reason is that if we split by frontend
          and backend, it will be a hard time for combing, because we may use
          different APIs. We both are standing on our side and hard to decide
          which way we need to use. Then we ask another student who has a lot of
          experience on full-stack projects already. He mentioned it is better
          to split by functions so that it will be much easier while we combine
          frontend and backend. We followed his advice and finished the project
          efficiently and got a pretty good grade on it. From this experience, I
          learned that while there is conflict, I need to compare each side’s
          pros and cons for getting the best decision. But if me and my teammate
          are both new to a field, we can’t just think for ourselves, we need to
          ask for people who have more experience with it, which will save lots
          of effort and complete the task on time.
        </p>
        <h3>Story 2:</h3>
        <p>
          While I was a business analyst in a hearing aid company. One of our
          responsibilities is to collaborate with the engineering team to
          deliver some features. One time, our team needed a button feature for
          our internal dashboard, which can provide franchisees and providers
          daily sales reports in pdf and excel format. Engineer time said they
          can finish it in 2 weeks, however our team needs them to finish it in
          one week, so that we can test data. So, there is a time comflict. Then
          I tried to communicate with the engineering team. I said, our
          providers really need this report so that we can check easily on their
          daily sales and view their store performance immediately. This feature
          could even increase profit for them. It is super important. And I know
          it could be a lot of work, but we can split the job into 2 parts. For
          the 1st week, you just need to have the basic function which export
          into excel, format and color is not necessary. Then on the 2nd week,
          we need to add all the functionality into it, export into both excel
          and pdf and all the color, style and our company logo need to be
          there. Finally they agreed with this plan and we finished it on time
          and the manager was satisfied with the result.
        </p>
        <h3>Story 3:</h3>
        <p>
          I was a business analyst for several years, it is kind of a challenge
          to transfer into programming. I remember when I tried to solve a
          medium algorithm problem for the first time, it took me 5 hours to
          think about how the solution would work. After I finally think I
          understand and I can rewrite it. But after 3 or 4 days, when I get
          back to the same problem, I am stuck again. It was super frustrating,
          because I spent whole days sitting there and trying to figure out
          algorithm problems, but I couldn't think of any solutions. Therefore,
          I asked a friend of mine who was an accountant before, to transfer
          into the programming side, and he is already a senior engineer. I told
          him what my problem is and how I can improve. Luckily, he mentioned it
          is normal to have a problem like this. But he recommended that I start
          with easy questions at first to understand deeply about each data
          structure. After tons of practice on easy questions, then move to
          medium questions. Because medium questions are usually combined with
          several easy problems. Starting with a medium problem can easily make
          people not confident about algorithms. He also mentioned that I can
          build some project by different languages so that get more familiar
          with different syntax and I will find out programming languages has a
          lot of things in common. And projects can increase my confidence and
          passion for programming. Then I followed his suggestion and get much
          better on algorithm problems. Although it is still a long way to go, I
          am confident I can go far and get a high skill on programming.
